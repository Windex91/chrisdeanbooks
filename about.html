    <h2>Short bio</h2>
    <p>
      Christopher Dean is an Australian Indie author, his debut novel
      <em>The Glass Tapestry</em> focuses on the power of choice, and how the
      consequences of our actions are always ready to bite back.

        <h2>Meet Chris</h2>
        <p>
                    Christopher Dean lives in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia, with his wife and two daughters. His love of fantasy began in early childhood with authors like Emily Rodda, Eoin Colfer, Fiona McIntosh and Christopher Paolini and that love only deepened as he reached into the enormous worlds of 
The Lord of the Rings, The Witcher, and Game of Thrones. 
These stories lit the spark that would eventually grow into a world of his own.
The stories came as way to entertain himself as he sat behind the wheel of a machine for long hours day after day. Crafting a world from nothing, shaping every corner of it, even the parts that may never appear on the page, became his favourite kind of creative freedom. 
Outside of writing, Christopher spends his time with his family, plays chess, and competes in both Strongman and Highland Games events. He brings all of these passions with him as he writes, drawing on the physicality of battle, the strategy of conflict, and the heart that binds people together.

        </p>
        <p>
          When he’s not writing, he’s usually thinking about writing, whether it's further world‑building, the strange logic of alternate
          realities, or just how far he can push his characters before they break. He also enjoys music, playing guitar, piano, and singing, as well as competing in strongman and highland games events.
